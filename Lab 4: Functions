feet. In your output ensure the results are all in uppercase and please rename the 
warehouse cities to "CapitalCity".
With this information, managers are able to anticipate where to store larger 
inventory items across the country so that they can adequately fit. 
They are also able to build new warehouses to accomodate for growing inventory 
numbers and in different regions of the country to be able to ship orders faster.

than having to look at an excel sheet filled with data that might not be
